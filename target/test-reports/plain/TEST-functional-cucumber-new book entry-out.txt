Feature: new book entry
  As a book owner
  I want to add books I own to the book tracker
  so that I do not have to remember them by myself

--Output from new book--
  Scenario: new book                               # NewBook.feature:6
    Given I open the book tracker                  # Book_steps.groovy:5
    When I add "Specification by Example"          # Book_steps.groovy:16
      Assertion failed: 
      
      assert false
      
      
      	at Book_steps$_run_closure2.doCall(Book_steps.groovy:17)
      	at âœ½.When I add "Specification by Example"(NewBook.feature:8)

    Then I see "Specification by Example"s details # Book_steps.groovy:20
